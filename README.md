# Project5_Blood_Bank_Management_System_CRUD_and_ADditional_functionalities
This project is a console-based Blood Bank Management System built in Python as part of my training at Kiran Academy. It allows efficient management of donor records, blood inventory, and transactions using CRUD operations. Additional features include blood group-wise search, donation history, and real-time stock updates.
